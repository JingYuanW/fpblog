Today I found out that I don't and doesn't have enough info to fully complete my project, so I have to being up new infomation and context to get a grip to what my project should be

I learned that robotics are much ore complex than what it looks like, and IDE can be used to design websites

I used Google to search up some info by following the class direction

A skill that I used was searching and organization since I am planning out what i needed to do and what I need in order to succeed
